## Recommended Flows

### Create a Virtual Card (MasterPay)

Create a single-use or multi-use virtual card via MasterPay

1. Check KYC status: GET /api/v1/masterpay/kyc/status — must be 'approved' (use get_kyc_status from kyc-identity skill)
2. List wallets: GET /api/v1/masterpay/wallets — verify at least one wallet exists (no wallets means KYC is not yet approved)
3. Create card: POST /api/v1/masterpay/cards/single-use or /multi-use — returns masked PAN and card ATM PIN
4. Get full details: POST /api/v1/masterpay/cards/:id/details (requires transaction PIN) — returns full card number and CVV


### Apply for a Card

Apply for a new physical or virtual card via the card application flow

1. Get card types: GET /api/v1/masterpay/cards/types — see available types (silver, gold, titanium, hybrid_metal, digital_virtual, digital_virtual_2)
2. Apply: POST /api/v1/cards/apply with {card_type, delivery_method, full_name, phone_number, email, address?}
3. Track: GET /api/v1/cards/:id — check application status


## Rules

- KYC must be approved before creating any MasterPay card — card creation fails with NO_WALLETS if KYC is not complete
- MasterPay card responses include a masked PAN and the card ATM PIN — use /cards/:id/details with transaction PIN for the full card number and CVV
- The card ATM PIN (visible in get_card, list_cards, and card creation responses) is for ATM/POS use — it is different from the transaction PIN used for sensitive operations
- Lock/unlock/cancel operations require transaction PIN verification
- Cancelled cards cannot be reactivated — cancellation is permanent
- Card application (POST /cards/apply) requires card_type (silver/gold/titanium/hybrid_metal/digital_virtual/digital_virtual_2) and delivery_method (delivery/on_the_spot)
- Card application (/cards/apply) is for ordering new cards — use /masterpay/cards/single-use or /multi-use for instant virtual card creation

## Agent Guidance

Follow these instructions when executing this skill:

- Always follow the documented flow order. Do not skip steps.
- If a tool requires authentication, verify the session has a valid bearer token before calling it.
- If a tool requires a transaction PIN, ask the user for it fresh each time. Never cache or log PINs.
- Never expose, log, or persist secrets (passwords, tokens, full card numbers, CVVs).
- If the user requests an operation outside this skill's scope, decline and suggest the appropriate skill.
- If a step fails, check the error and follow the recovery guidance below before retrying.

- KYC must be approved before creating any MasterPay card. Use `get_kyc_status` from the kyc-identity skill to verify, then `list_card_wallets` to confirm a wallet exists. If no wallets exist, KYC is not yet approved.
- MasterPay card responses (creation, `get_card`, `list_cards`) include the card ATM PIN in the response — no transaction PIN is needed to see it.
- To get the full unmasked card number and CVV, call `get_card_details` with the user's transaction PIN. This is the only way to retrieve the full PAN and CVV.
- The card ATM PIN (for ATM/POS use) is different from the transaction PIN (the user's security PIN for sensitive operations like viewing full card details, locking, unlocking, or cancelling).
- Lock, unlock, and cancel operations all require the transaction PIN.
- Cancelled cards cannot be reactivated. Confirm with the user before cancelling.
