### Manual

Copy this folder to your Clawdbot skills directory:

```bash
# Global installation
cp -r . ~/.clawdbot/skills/buy-anything

# Or workspace installation
cp -r . ./skills/buy-anything
```

## Usage

Just ask Clawdbot to buy something from Amazon or any Shopify store:

```
You: Buy this for me https://amazon.com/dp/B0DJLKV4N9

Clawdbot: I'll help you buy that! Where should I ship it?

You: John Doe, 123 Main St, San Francisco CA 94102, john@example.com, +14155551234

Clawdbot: Got it! What's your max purchase price? (I'll warn you before exceeding it)

You: $500

Clawdbot: I'm opening a secure card entry page in your browser.
          Enter your card details there — they never touch this chat.
          After submitting, copy the token and paste it here.
          [Opens browser to card capture page]

You: d1ff0c32-a1b2-4c3d-8e4f-567890abcdef

Clawdbot: Order placed!
          Total: $358.44 (includes 3% service fee)
          Confirmation: RYE-ABC123

          Want me to save your card token for next time?
```

After saving, future purchases are one message:

```
You: Buy this https://cool-store.com/products/gadget

Clawdbot: Order placed! Total: $29.99
```

## How Payments Work

### The short version

When you make your first purchase, Clawdbot opens a secure card entry page in your browser. Your card details go directly to [BasisTheory](https://basistheory.com/) — a PCI-certified token vault — and are converted into a reusable token. Your card number never appears in chat, never touches Clawdbot, and never reaches Rye's servers. Only the token ID is used for purchases.

### Under the hood

```
Clawdbot opens card capture page in your browser
        |
        v
You enter card details
(BasisTheory secure iframes — card goes directly to BT vault)
        |
        v
BasisTheory returns token ID
You copy it back into chat
        |
        v
+----------------+
|   Rye API      | <-- Only sees the BT token ID, never your card
|   Purchase     |
+--------+-------+
         |
         v
Shopify: card forwarded directly to store
Amazon: token converted to payment server-side (3% fee)
```

1. **Clawdbot opens a secure page** — a hosted web page with BasisTheory's PCI-compliant card elements loads in your browser
2. **You enter your card** — card details are captured in BasisTheory's secure iframes and sent directly to their vault. The card never appears in chat or in any Clawdbot process
3. **BasisTheory returns a token** — a reusable token ID (e.g. `d1ff0c32-...`) that represents your card
4. **You paste the token** — copy the token from the page and paste it into chat. This is an opaque ID, not your card number
5. **Token is used to pay** — the Rye API receives only the token to place the order. For Shopify stores, the card is forwarded directly to the store's payment processor. For Amazon, it's converted server-side

### Saved cards

When you save your card for future purchases, only the **BasisTheory token ID** is stored in Clawdbot's memory on your device — not your card number, expiry, or CVC. The token can only be used through Rye's API and cannot be reverse-engineered back to your card details. Future purchases reuse this token directly with no card entry needed.

To remove your saved card, ask Clawdbot to forget your card token. To also revoke the token from BasisTheory's vault, contact [support@rye.com](mailto:support@rye.com).

## Guardrails

### Spending limit

On your first purchase, Clawdbot will ask you to set a maximum purchase price. If any order (including fees) would exceed your limit, Clawdbot will warn you and ask for confirmation before proceeding. You can say "no limit" to skip this.

You can update your limit at any time by telling Clawdbot:

```
You: Set my max purchase to $200
You: Remove my spending limit
```

### Order confirmations

Every order sends an email confirmation to the address you provide, so you always have a receipt and tracking info.

## Pricing & Shipping

- **Shopify stores**: Standard store pricing — no markup from us
- **Amazon**: 3% fee to cover transaction costs
- Amazon orders under $15 have a $6.99 shipping charge
- Amazon orders $15 and above get free 2-day Prime shipping

## Good to Know

- Shopify orders go through the store's normal checkout — the store handles fulfillment directly
- Amazon orders are processed through a third-party Amazon account — you can't connect orders to your personal Amazon account at this time
- You'll receive an email with order confirmation and details after each purchase
- For returns or refunds, contact support@rye.com
