The AI automatically uses this skill when you ask to start live activities. 
It handles different priority levels:

- **INFO**: Starts a activity for informational purposes. ( Blue )
- **WARN**: This is a kind of important activity, but not that serious. ( Yellow )
- **CRIT**: Somehting needs immediate attention. This is serious ( Red )
- **SUCCESS**: All good again. ( Green )

### Example Prompts:

- "Start an activity of critical importance on my phones"
- "Start a informational activity on my phone with title "Openclaw backup", body "Backup in progress...", 1 step, 10% progress. Show the legend with "Backup started" as start-text and "Backup ended" as end-text."
- "Progress my activity to 20%"
- "Set the severity of my activity to warn and progress it by 10%"
- "End my activity, and delay the dismissal for 5 minutes"
