# Photo Captions

When the user shares a photo with context (location, camera, lens, film stock, subject, mood), generate captions for all platforms below in one response. Each platform has a distinct voice and format.

If the user specifies gear (camera body, lens, film stock, digital settings), include it where appropriate. Don't fabricate gear details the user didn't provide.

## Platforms

### 📸 Instagram
- **Tone**: Short, evocative, slightly poetic or witty. Let the image speak.
- **Format**: 1-2 line caption → blank line → gear line (if provided) → blank line → hashtags.
- **Hashtags**: Exactly 5 tags (Instagram's current limit). Pick the 5 most impactful: prioritize genre (e.g. `#filmphotography`), location, film stock/gear, and one mood/style tag. Quality over quantity.

### 📷 Flickr
- **Tone**: Slightly more descriptive and contemplative. Flickr audiences appreciate story and craft.
- **Format**: Italicized title, dash, then 1-3 sentences of context/story. End with gear info.
- **Include**: Location context, what drew the photographer to the shot. Think photo essay voice.

### 🐦 X (Twitter)
- **Tone**: Punchy, concise, dry. Under 280 characters ideally. No hashtag spam.
- **Format**: One strong line about the image. Gear at the end if it fits naturally.
- **Goal**: Makes someone stop scrolling.

### 🪟 Glass
- **Tone**: Photographer-to-photographer. Understated, genuine. No hashtags, no engagement bait.
- **Format**: 1-3 sentences. Location and brief observation. Gear on a separate line with middle dots (·) as separators.
- **Vibe**: Like talking to a friend at a photo walk.

### 🟦 Tumblr
- **Tone**: More literary, expressive, slightly longer. Tumblr appreciates mood and storytelling.
- **Format**: Bold location as title. 2-4 sentences of narrative/reflection. Gear line. Then tags.
- **Tags**: Use spaces in Tumblr tags: `#film photography` not `#filmphotography`. 8-12 tags.

### 🔵 Bluesky
- **Tone**: Conversational, warm, community-minded. Similar energy to early Twitter.
- **Format**: 1-2 sentences, casual but thoughtful. Under 300 characters. Gear mention optional.
- **No hashtags** unless they add real value (Bluesky culture leans anti-hashtag-spam).

### 🧵 Threads
- **Tone**: Casual, Instagram-adjacent but more conversational. Think talking to followers, not curating a gallery.
- **Format**: 1-2 sentences, relaxed. Gear mention if interesting. Minimal hashtags (3-5 max).

### 🔢 500px
- **Tone**: Technical and craft-focused. 500px is a photography-first community that values technique.
- **Format**: Title line, then 1-3 sentences covering the shot — technique, conditions, what made it work. Always include full gear details.
- **Include**: Camera settings, lighting conditions, or technique notes when available.

### 🟠 Reddit
- **Tone**: Authentic, slightly self-deprecating, community-friendly. No self-promotion vibes.
- **Format**: Post title (concise, descriptive) + comment body with context and gear.
- **Title**: Location or subject + gear in brackets, e.g. `Bombay Beach [Canon EOS 1V, Tri-X 400]`
- **Comment**: 2-3 sentences of context/story. Mention relevant subreddits: r/analog for film, r/photography for digital, r/streetphotography, r/LandscapePhotography, etc.

### 👤 Facebook
- **Tone**: Personal, conversational, like sharing with friends and family. Most accessible voice.
- **Format**: 2-3 casual sentences. Story-driven — where you were, what you were doing, why it caught your eye. Gear mention only if it adds to the story.
- **No hashtags** (or 1-2 at most). Facebook audiences care about the story, not the craft.

### 🎞️ VSCO
- **Tone**: Minimal, poetic, understated. VSCO is the quiet gallery — let the image breathe.
- **Format**: 1 line max. Sometimes just a single word or short phrase. No hashtags.
- **Vibe**: Think whispered, not announced. VSCO captions are closer to titles than descriptions. The less you say, the better.
- **No gear talk** unless it's film stock and even then, keep it subtle.

### 📝 Substack
- **Tone**: Narrative, essayistic, author-voiced. Substack readers expect prose — this is a photo caption inside a long-form piece, not a social post.
- **Format**: 2-4 sentences that work as in-line caption text below a photo in a newsletter. Rich with context — where you were, what you noticed, why it stuck. Reads like a magazine photo caption crossed with a personal essay fragment.
- **Include**: Gear if it adds texture to the story. Location and conditions. The feeling behind the frame, not just the description of it.
- **Vibe**: New Yorker caption meets travel journal. Specific, unhurried, earned. The reader should feel like they're getting the real story, not a caption.
- **No hashtags**, no engagement bait, no calls to action.

### 📌 Pinterest
- **Tone**: Descriptive and searchable. Pinterest is a discovery engine — think SEO meets aesthetics.
- **Format**: Two parts, both required:
  - **Title**: Short, keyword-rich (5-10 words). Format: `[Subject/Mood] — [Location]` or `[Style] [Subject], [Location]`. Examples: "Desert Road at Dusk, Amboy California" or "Film Photography, Mojave Desert Landscape"
  - **Description**: 2-3 sentences describing the scene, mood, and style. Include relevant keywords naturally (location, style, film stock if applicable, mood, themes like road trip, desert, americana, etc.)
- **Goal**: Someone searching "desert film photography" or "Route 66 aesthetic" should find this pin.
- **No hashtags** — Pinterest uses keywords in descriptions for discovery, not tags.

## After Generating Captions

After delivering all captions, update the Apple Notes log. Use the script to prepend the new entry to the running note (newest at top):

```bash
python3 /root/.openclaw/workspace/tools/update_captions_note.py \
  "<Photo Title / Location>" \
  "<Camera · Film/Settings>" \
  "<captions as HTML string>"
```

The script finds the existing "Photo Captions Log" note in Apple Notes (via IMAP), deletes it, and saves a new version with the latest entry at the top. Do this silently — don't announce it to Paul unless it fails.

## Guidelines

- Adapt all captions to the specific photo content, location, and mood.
- Don't repeat the same phrase across platforms. Each should feel native to its community.
- Humor and wit are welcome but should match the photo's mood.
- If the photo is black and white, add relevant B&W tags where appropriate.
- Never be generic. Every caption should feel written specifically for that image.
- For film photos, lean into the analog aesthetic. For digital, focus on the moment and technique.
- If the user only wants specific platforms, generate only those.
- Write like a human, not a copywriter. **No emdashes (—) anywhere, ever.** No semicolons for drama, no overly polished prose. Use periods, commas, and natural sentence breaks. If you wouldn't say it out loud, don't write it. The middle dot (·) is fine for gear lines on Glass/Flickr/500px only.
