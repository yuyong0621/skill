description: Ultimate Frisbee performance analytics powered by Garmin data. Ask "how many sprints did I hit in yesterday's game?", "was my recovery fast enough between points?", "am I more fatigued than last tournament?". Analyze sprint count & fatigue, top speed, heart rate zones, Body Battery, HRV trends, sleep quality, and generate interactive dashboards. Compare tournaments vs tournaments, training vs games, and track season-long fitness trends. Built for competitive Ultimate Frisbee players.

# Garmin Frisbee Analysis

Analyze Garmin health and performance data specifically for Ultimate Frisbee players. Generate interactive HTML dashboards for post-game review, tournament fatigue tracking, training load optimization, and season-long trend comparison.

## Two Installation Paths

1. **Clawdbot Skill** (this guide) — Use with Clawdbot for natural language queries and proactive monitoring
2. **MCP Server** ([see MCP setup guide](references/mcp_setup.md)) — Use with Claude Desktop as an MCP server

---

## Setup (first time only)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install garminconnect fitparse gpxpy
```

### 2. Configure Credentials

#### Option A: Clawdbot Config (Recommended)

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "garmin-frisbee-analysis": {
        "enabled": true,
        "env": {
          "GARMIN_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
          "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "your-password"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
python3 scripts/garmin_auth.py login --email YOUR_EMAIL --password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
python3 scripts/garmin_auth.py login
python3 scripts/garmin_auth.py status   # verify
```

## Frisbee Scripts

### Post-Game / Post-Training Analysis

Analyze a single activity in depth: sprints, speed, heart rate zones.

```bash
# Most recent activity
python3 scripts/frisbee_activity.py --latest

# Specific date
python3 scripts/frisbee_activity.py --date 2026-03-08

# Specific activity ID
python3 scripts/frisbee_activity.py --activity-id 12345678

# Save to file
python3 scripts/frisbee_activity.py --latest --output ~/Desktop/game.html
```

**Dashboard includes:**
- Summary cards: duration, distance, sprint count, top speed, sprint fatigue index, high-intensity distance
- Speed timeline with sprint highlight bands
- Sprint peak speed trend (detects fatigue: are later sprints slower?)
- Heart rate zone distribution (Zone 1–6)

**Sprint detection:** speed > 14.4 km/h sustained ≥ 2 seconds.
**Sprint Fatigue Index:** last 3 sprint peaks ÷ first 3 sprint peaks. < 0.85 = significant fatigue.

---

### Tournament Review Dashboard

Full overview of a multi-day tournament: fatigue curve, game intensity, heart rate recovery, overnight sleep/HRV.

```bash
python3 scripts/frisbee_tournament.py \
  --start 2026-03-08 \
  --end 2026-03-10 \
  --name "Spring Tournament 2026" \
  --output ~/Desktop/tournament.html
```

**Dashboard includes:**
- Body Battery fatigue curve across tournament days (includes day-before baseline)
- Per-game avg/max heart rate comparison
- Heart Rate Recovery curves post-game (30 min window, all games overlaid)
- Overnight sleep hours + HRV per tournament night
- Activity table with all detected games

---

### Comparison Analysis

Compare training sessions, games, or the full season.

```bash
# Training vs training (last 90 days)
python3 scripts/frisbee_compare.py --mode training --days 90

# Game vs game
python3 scripts/frisbee_compare.py --mode tournament --days 180

# Training intensity vs game intensity
python3 scripts/frisbee_compare.py --mode cross --days 60

# Full season overview
python3 scripts/frisbee_compare.py --mode season --days 180

# Save output
python3 scripts/frisbee_compare.py --mode season --days 180 --output ~/Desktop/season.html
```

**Activity classification** uses name keywords:
- Game: `game`, `match`, `tournament`, `vs`, `finals`
- Training: `practice`, `training`, `train`, `drill`, `scrimmage`

**Dashboard includes:**
- Top speed trend over time (training vs game color-coded in cross mode)
- Avg heart rate per activity (color by intensity)
- Morning HRV on day of each activity
- Volume trend: duration + distance over time
- Full activity table

## Answering Frisbee Questions

| Player asks | Script | What to report |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| "How many sprints did I hit?" | `frisbee_activity.py --latest` | sprint_count, sprint fatigue index |
| "What was my top speed?" | `frisbee_activity.py --latest` | top_speed_kmh from summary |
| "Was I fatigued at the end?" | `frisbee_activity.py --latest` | sprint_fatigue_index < 0.85 = yes |
| "How long was my heart rate elevated?" | `frisbee_activity.py --latest` | Zone 4-6 time percentage |
| "Did I recover fast enough between points?" | `frisbee_tournament.py` | HRR curves, slope comparison |
| "Was I ready for the tournament?" | `frisbee_tournament.py` | Pre-game Body Battery values |

## Key Frisbee Metrics Explained

### Sprint Fatigue Index
Ratio of last 3 sprint peak speeds to first 3: `≥ 0.95` stable, `0.85–0.95` mild decline, `< 0.85` significant fatigue. Use this to judge if you're losing speed output as the game progresses.

### Heart Rate Recovery (HRR)
How fast your HR drops after game ends. Steeper curve = better cardiovascular fitness and recovery. Flatter curves in later games of a tournament = cumulative fatigue.

### Body Battery (0–100)
Pre-game value is the key readiness indicator. `≥ 70` = ready to go, `50–69` = manageable, `< 50` = compromised performance likely.

### Heart Rate Zones
- **Zone 4 (70–80% max)**: Sustained hard effort — hallmark of well-executed frisbee
- **Zone 5–6 (80–100% max)**: Explosive sprints and close contests
- High Zone 4–6 in training = adequate game-prep intensity

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"FIT file download failed"**: Check activity ID; some activity types may not export FIT
- **No sprints detected**: Activity may not include speed data, or you used a non-GPS mode
- **HRR chart empty**: Intraday HR not available for that date; ensure "All-day HR monitoring" is on in Garmin settings
- **Activities not classified**: Name your activities with keywords like "game vs X" or "practice" — see classification keywords above
- **Tokens expired**: Re-run `python3 scripts/garmin_auth.py login`

---

## Privacy

- Credentials stored locally in `~/.clawdbot/garmin-tokens.json`
- No data sent anywhere except Garmin's official servers
