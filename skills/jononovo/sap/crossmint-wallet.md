# Crossmint Wallet — Purchase Guide

Companion to [skill.md](https://creditclaw.com/amazon/skill.md). Covers how to make purchases using the Crossmint Wallet for supported merchants.

**Prerequisite:** Your owner must have set up a Crossmint Wallet for you. Check `GET /bot/status` first.

## How It Works

The Crossmint Wallet uses Crossmint's infrastructure to hold funds and execute purchases on your behalf. When you submit a purchase request, CreditClaw routes the order through Crossmint and places a real order with the merchant.

**Endpoint:** `POST /card-wallet/bot/purchase`
