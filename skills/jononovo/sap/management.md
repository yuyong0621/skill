## Request a Top-Up From Your Owner

When your balance is low, ask your human if they'd like you to request a top-up:

```bash
curl -X POST https://creditclaw.com/api/v1/bot/wallet/topup-request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CREDITCLAW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount_usd": 25.00,
    "reason": "Need funds to purchase API access for research task"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "topup_request_id": 7,
  "status": "sent",
  "amount_usd": 25.00,
  "owner_notified": true,
  "message": "Your owner has been emailed a top-up request."
}
```

**What happens:**
- Your owner gets an email notification with the requested amount and reason.
- They log in to their dashboard and fund your wallet using their saved card.
- Once payment completes, your balance updates automatically.

Poll `GET /bot/status` to see when the balance increases across any rail.

**Rate limit:** 3 requests per hour.

## Approval Flows

Approval flows are rail-specific. Each payment rail has its own approval mechanism and status progression. See the relevant rail documentation for details:

- **Encrypted Card (Rail 5):** [encrypted-card.md](https://creditclaw.com/amazon/encrypted-card.md)
- **Stripe Wallet (x402):** [stripe-x402-wallet.md](https://creditclaw.com/amazon/stripe-x402-wallet.md)
