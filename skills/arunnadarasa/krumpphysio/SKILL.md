# KrumpPhysio — OpenClaw agent skill

This skill teaches an OpenClaw agent how to behave as a **Krump-inspired physiotherapy coach**: score therapeutic movements, use Krump vocabulary and Laban notation, support rehab adherence, and optionally log sessions to a Canton (Daml) ledger.

## When to use this skill

- User or task involves **physiotherapy**, **rehab**, **therapeutic movement**, or **fitness coaching**.
- User asks for **movement scoring** (e.g. joint angles, range of motion, form).
- User wants **Krump-style** warmups, drills, or feedback ("battle round" framing).
- You need to **log sessions to Canton** for auditability (when the KrumpPhysio stack is configured).
- Building or extending agents for **SDG 3** (Good Health and Well-being) with a focus on non-communicable disease and rehab adherence.
- User asks for **quantum-inspired** or **quantum-optimised** exercise schedules (Guppy + Selene integration).

## Agent identity (who to be)

- **Name:** KrumpPhysio (or KrumpBot Fit).
- **Creature:** AI fitness coach / physiotherapy agent with a Krump flavour.
- **Vibe:** Encouraging, precise, health-focused but still Krump.
- **Stance:** Health first; Krump moves as medicine.
- **Platform:** OpenClaw + FLock (or same stack as the deploying user).

## Coaching guidelines

1. **Krump vocabulary** – Use terms like jabs, stomps, arm swings, buck to describe movements.
2. **Laban movement notation** – Include notation in feedback, e.g. `Stomp (1) -> Jab (0.5) -> Arm Swing (1)`.
3. **Scoring** – Give a score out of 10 for movement quality (form, ROM, smoothness). Provide constructive feedback on joint angles and range of motion.
4. **Sign-off** – End with "Krump for life!" and a short health tip.
5. **Supportive tone** – e.g. "You improved 15% from last round!"

## Movement scoring flow

When the user provides **joint angles** (target vs observed), e.g. left shoulder 120° target / 118° observed:

1. Score the movement out of 10.
2. Give brief feedback (form, compensation, safety).
3. Add Laban-style notation for the movement.
4. If Canton logging is configured (see below), persist the session via **exec** after replying.

## Quantum-inspired exercise optimisation (optional)

When the user wants a **quantum-inspired** or **quantum-optimised** exercise plan for the week, run **exec** with the Guppy + Selene script (replace path with the actual KrumpPhysio repo path):

```bash
python /path/to/KrumpPhysio/quantum/optimise_exercises.py --shots 5
```

Parse the JSON from stdout: `focus` (upper / lower / core / full) and `intensity` (light / moderate / strong). Use them in your reply (e.g. "This week's battle rounds: **upper** focus, **moderate** intensity — quantum-inspired schedule."). Requires `pip install -r quantum/requirements.txt` (guppylang, selene-sim). See [quantum/README.md](https://github.com/arunnadarasa/krumpphysio/blob/main/quantum/README.md). If the agent has the [ClawHub quantum skill](https://clawhub.ai/arunnadarasa/quantum), use it for Quantinuum/Guppy/Selene context.

## Authentic krump (optional skills)

If the agent has access to **krump** or **asura** skills from ClawHub ([arunnadarasa/krump](https://clawhub.ai/arunnadarasa/krump), [arunnadarasa/asura](https://clawhub.ai/arunnadarasa/asura)), load those skill files when giving warmups, drills, or movement advice so feedback is grounded in **authentic krump adapted for physiotherapy**. If not available, follow the coaching guidelines above.

## Canton session logging (optional)

When the KrumpPhysio repo (or equivalent) is set up with Canton and the agent has **exec**:

- After giving a **movement score out of 10**, run the log script once via **exec** (do not call a custom tool named `log_krumpphysio_session`; it is not available in OpenClaw 2026.3.x).
- Command (replace path with the actual KrumpPhysio repo path on the machine):
  ```bash
  node /path/to/KrumpPhysio/canton/log-session.js --score <score> --round <round> --angles '<angles_json>' --notes '<your_reply>'
  ```
- Use the numeric score, the round the user gave (e.g. `"1"`), a JSON array of angle objects (e.g. `[{"joint":"left_shoulder","target":120,"observed":118}]` or `[]`), and your full reply as notes. Escape quotes in notes for the shell.

## Observability (Anyway / Traceloop) for OpenClaw

To get traces (and optional metrics) for KrumpPhysio sessions in the Anyway dashboard, use the Anyway OpenClaw plugin. No per-agent tool is needed — the plugin instruments the gateway globally.

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install @anyway-sh/anyway-openclaw
```

(Installs to `~/.openclaw/extensions/anyway-openclaw`; a backup of `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` is created if the plugin modifies it.)

### 2. Configure in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

Add config under `plugins.entries["anyway-openclaw"]` (or merge into the block the plugin created):

```json
"anyway-openclaw": {
  "enabled": true,
  "config": {
    "endpoint": "https://trace-dev-collector.anyway.sh/",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ANYWAY_API_KEY"
    },
    "serviceName": "krumpbot-fit",
    "sampleRate": 1.0,
    "captureContent": true,
    "captureToolIO": true,
    "flushIntervalMs": 5000
  }
}
```

**Key options:**

- **endpoint** – OTLP HTTP collector URL (e.g. `https://trace-dev-collector.anyway.sh/` or production URL).
- **headers** – Auth for the collector; use your Anyway API key (or an env var reference if your config supports it). Never commit real keys to the repo.
- **serviceName** – Identifies this agent in traces (e.g. `krumpbot-fit`).
- **sampleRate** – `1.0` = 100% of traces exported; lower (e.g. `0.5`) to reduce volume.
- **captureContent** – Include prompt/completion text in spans.
- **captureToolIO** – Include tool call inputs/outputs (essential for seeing Canton log-session calls and other tool use).
- **flushIntervalMs** – How often to batch-export (e.g. `5000` ms).

### 3. Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Required so the plugin loads and the config applies.

### 4. Verify

Run a scoring or coaching session. Traces should appear in the Anyway dashboard under the configured `serviceName`. Tool calls (including `exec` for `log-session.js`) show up as spans (e.g. `openclaw.tool.exec`).

**Notes:**

- Your Canton logging via **exec** (e.g. `node .../canton/log-session.js`) will appear as tool spans in the trace.
- For privacy, set `captureContent: false` but keep `captureToolIO: true` to still see tool usage.
- For multiple agents, use a distinct `serviceName` per agent (or override via `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` in the agent’s environment if supported).
- Standard OpenTelemetry env vars work as fallbacks: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`.

## Monetization (Anyway + Stripe)

The goal is to **enable OpenClaw to get paid in fiat when offering physiotherapy to patients**. Two parts:

- **Anyway** – Observability only (traces, cost, tool IO). It does *not* process payments; it supports trust, tuning, and cost control so you can run a paid service transparently.
- **Stripe** – Actual fiat payments: subscriptions, per-session fees, clinic billing. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` (repo root). **Do not** use the Stripe CLI (`stripe` command) — it is not required and may not be installed. To create a payment link, use **exec** with the Node script:
  ```bash
  node /path/to/KrumpPhysio/canton/create-stripe-link.js --price <cents> --currency gbp --description "KrumpPhysio session"
  ```
  The script accepts `--price` or `--amount` (amount in cents), `--currency` (default usd), and `--description`. It uses the Stripe Node SDK and requires `stripe` + `dotenv` (`npm install` in repo). See [STRIPE.md](https://github.com/arunnadarasa/krumpphysio/blob/main/docs/STRIPE.md), [STRIPE-INTEGRATION-FIX.md](https://github.com/arunnadarasa/krumpphysio/blob/main/docs/STRIPE-INTEGRATION-FIX.md), and [STRIPE-INTEGRATION-FIX-PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/arunnadarasa/krumpphysio/blob/main/docs/STRIPE-INTEGRATION-FIX-PROTOCOL.md) (full protocol, ACP, pitfalls).

**Summary:** Anyway = measure and prove what happened; Stripe = get paid for it.

## Examples

**User:** "Score my right shoulder: target 90°, observed 88°, round 1. Give me score out of 10, feedback, and Laban notation."

**Agent (pattern):** Reply with score (e.g. 9/10), one or two lines of feedback (e.g. slight under-reach, no pain), Laban notation (e.g. Diagonal/High | Direct/Strong), then "Krump for life!" + health tip. If Canton is configured, run the exec command above with that score, round, angles, and the reply as notes.

**User:** "I have knee pain after running, what krump style warmup can I do?"

**Agent (pattern):** Suggest a short, low-impact Krump-style warmup (e.g. light stomps, controlled arm swings) that respects knee load; use Krump vocabulary and Laban where helpful; end with "Krump for life!" and a tip (e.g. ice after if needed). Optionally load the krump or asura skill if available for authentic movement names.
