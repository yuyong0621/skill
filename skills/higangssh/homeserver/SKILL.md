# Homeserver Management

Manage homelab servers using the [`homebutler`](https://github.com/Higangssh/homebutler) CLI. Single binary, JSON output, AI-friendly.

## Prerequisites

`homebutler` must be installed and available in PATH.

```bash
# Check if installed
which homebutler

# Option 1: Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install Higangssh/homebutler/homebutler

# Option 2: Install via Go
go install github.com/Higangssh/homebutler@latest

# Option 3: Build from source
git clone https://github.com/Higangssh/homebutler.git
cd homebutler && make build && sudo mv homebutler /usr/local/bin/
```

## Commands

### Setup Wizard
```bash
homebutler init                      # Interactive config setup
```
Creates a config file at `~/.config/homebutler/config.yaml` with guided prompts.

### System Status
```bash
homebutler status                    # Local server
homebutler status --server rpi       # Specific remote server
homebutler status --all              # All servers in parallel
```
Returns: hostname, OS, arch, uptime, CPU (usage%, cores), memory (total/used/%), disks (mount/total/used/%)

### Docker Management
```bash
homebutler docker list               # List all containers
homebutler docker list --server rpi  # List on remote server
homebutler docker list --all         # List on all servers
homebutler docker restart <name>     # Restart a container
homebutler docker stop <name>        # Stop a container
homebutler docker logs <name>        # Last 50 lines of logs
homebutler docker logs <name> 200    # Last 200 lines
```

### Wake-on-LAN
```bash
homebutler wake <mac-address>           # Wake by MAC
homebutler wake <name>                   # Wake by config name
homebutler wake <mac> 192.168.1.255     # Custom broadcast
```
Config names are defined in config under `wake` targets.

### Open Ports
```bash
homebutler ports                     # Local
homebutler ports --server rpi        # Remote
homebutler ports --all               # All servers
```
Returns: protocol, address, port, PID, process name

### Network Scan
```bash
homebutler network scan
```
Discovers devices on the local LAN via ping sweep + ARP table. Returns: IP, MAC, hostname, status.
Note: May take up to 30 seconds. Some devices may not appear if they don't respond to ping.

### TUI Dashboard
```bash
homebutler watch                     # Live terminal dashboard for all servers
```
Real-time monitoring of all configured servers with auto-refresh. Shows CPU, memory, disk, docker containers in a terminal UI.

### Web Dashboard
```bash
homebutler serve                     # Start web dashboard on port 8080
homebutler serve --port 3000         # Custom port
homebutler serve --demo              # Demo mode with fake data (no real system calls)
```
Browser-based dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`. Read-only view of all servers, docker containers, alerts.

### SSH Host Key Trust
```bash
homebutler trust <server>            # Trust remote server's SSH host key
homebutler trust <server> --reset    # Remove old key and re-trust
```
TOFU (Trust On First Use) model. Required before first SSH connection to a new server.

### Upgrade
```bash
homebutler upgrade                   # Upgrade local + all remote servers
homebutler upgrade --local           # Upgrade only local binary
```
Downloads latest release from GitHub and installs it. For remote servers, uses SSH to upgrade.

### Resource Alerts
```bash
homebutler alerts                    # Local
homebutler alerts --server rpi       # Remote
homebutler alerts --all              # All servers
```
Checks CPU/memory/disk against thresholds in config. Returns status (ok/warning/critical) per resource.

### Deploy (Remote Installation)
```bash
homebutler deploy --server rpi                          # Download from GitHub Releases
homebutler deploy --server rpi --local ./homebutler     # Air-gapped: copy local binary
homebutler deploy --all                                 # Deploy to all remote servers
```
Installs homebutler on remote servers via SSH. Auto-detects remote OS/architecture.
Install path priority: `/usr/local/bin` → `sudo /usr/local/bin` → `~/.local/bin` (with PATH auto-registration in .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc).

### MCP Server
```bash
homebutler mcp                       # Start MCP server (JSON-RPC over stdio)
```
Starts a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for use with Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other MCP clients. Exposes all homebutler tools (system_status, docker_list, docker_restart, docker_stop, docker_logs, wake, open_ports, network_scan, alerts) via standard MCP protocol. No network ports opened — uses stdio only.

### Version
```bash
homebutler version
```

## Output Format

All commands output human-readable text by default. Use `--json` flag for machine-parseable JSON output (recommended for AI/script integration).

## Config File

Config file is auto-discovered in order:
1. `--config <path>` — Explicit flag
2. `$HOMEBUTLER_CONFIG` — Environment variable
3. `~/.config/homebutler/config.yaml` — XDG standard (recommended)
4. `./homebutler.yaml` — Current directory

If no config found, sensible defaults are used.

### Config Options
- `servers` — Server list with SSH connection details
- `wake` — Named WOL targets with MAC + broadcast
- `alerts.cpu/memory/disk` — Threshold percentages
- `output` — Default output format

### Multi-Server Config Example
```yaml
servers:
  - name: main-server
    host: 192.168.1.10
    local: true

  - name: rpi
    host: 192.168.1.20
    user: pi
    auth: key                # "key" (default, recommended) or "password"
    key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519   # optional, auto-detects

  - name: vps
    host: example.com
    user: deploy
    port: 2222
    auth: key
    key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Always run commands, don't guess** — execute `homebutler status` to get real data
2. **Interpret results for the user** — don't dump raw JSON, summarize in natural language
3. **Warn on alerts** — if any resource shows "warning" or "critical", highlight it
4. **Use --all for overview** — when user asks about "all servers" or "everything", use `--all`
5. **Use --server for specific** — when user mentions a server by name, use `--server <name>`
6. **Docker errors** — if docker is not installed or daemon not running, explain clearly
7. **Network scan** — warn user it may take ~30 seconds
8. **Security** — never expose raw JSON with hostnames/IPs in group chats, summarize instead
9. **Deploy** — suggest `--local` for air-gapped environments

## Security Notes

- **SSH authentication**: Always prefer key-based auth over passwords. Never store plaintext passwords in config.
- **Network scans**: Only run on your own local network. Warn user before scanning.
- **Deploy**: Only deploy to servers you own. Confirm with user before remote installations.
- **Config file permissions**: Keep config files readable only by owner (`chmod 600`).
- **No telemetry**: homebutler sends zero data externally. All operations are local or to user-configured hosts only.

## Error Handling

- **SSH connection failed** → Check host/port/user in config, verify SSH key is registered on remote
- **homebutler not found on remote** → Run `homebutler deploy --server <name>` first
- **docker not installed** → Tell user docker is not available on that server
- **docker daemon not running** → Suggest `sudo systemctl start docker`
- **network scan timeout** → Normal on large subnets, suggest retrying
- **permission denied** → May need sudo for ports/docker commands on some systems

## Example Interactions

User: "How's the server doing?"
→ Run `homebutler status`, summarize: "CPU 23%, memory 40%, disk 37%. Uptime 42 days. All good 👍"

User: "Check all servers"
→ Run `homebutler status --all`, summarize each server's status

User: "How's the Raspberry Pi?"
→ Run `homebutler status --server rpi`, summarize

User: "What docker containers are running?"
→ Run `homebutler docker list`, list container names and states

User: "Wake up the NAS"
→ Run `homebutler wake nas` (if configured) or ask for MAC address

User: "Any alerts across all servers?"
→ Run `homebutler alerts --all`, report any warnings/critical

User: "Deploy homebutler to the new server"
→ Run `homebutler deploy --server <name>`, report result
