# Wilma Skill

## Overview

Wilma is the Finnish school information system used by schools and municipalities to share messages, news, exams, schedules, homework, and other student-related updates with parents/guardians.

Use the `wilma` / `wilmai` CLI in non-interactive mode to retrieve Wilma data for AI agents. Prefer `--json` outputs and avoid interactive prompts.

## Quick start

### Install
```bash
npm i -g @wilm-ai/wilma-cli
```

1. Ensure the user has run the interactive CLI once to create `~/.config/wilmai/config.json`.
2. Use non-interactive commands with `--json`.

## Core tasks

### Daily briefing (start here)
```bash
wilma summary --student <id|name> --json
wilma summary --all-students --json
```
Returns today's and tomorrow's schedule, upcoming exams, recent homework, recent news, and recent messages in one call. This is the best starting point for any parent-facing summary.

### Schedule
```bash
wilma schedule list --when today --student <id|name> --json
wilma schedule list --when tomorrow --student <id|name> --json
wilma schedule list --when week --student <id|name> --json
wilma schedule list --date 2026-03-10 --student <id|name> --json
wilma schedule list --weekday thu --student <id|name> --json
```
`--weekday` also accepts Finnish short forms: `ma`, `ti`, `ke`, `to`, `pe`, `la`, `su`. Use `--date` or `--weekday`, not both.

### Homework
```bash
wilma homework list --student <id|name> --json
```

### Upcoming exams
```bash
wilma exams list --student <id|name> --json
```

### Exam grades
```bash
wilma grades list --student <id|name> --json
```

### List students
```bash
wilma kids list --json
```

### News and messages
```bash
wilma news list --student <id|name> --json
wilma news read <id> --student <id|name> --json
wilma messages list --student <id|name> --folder inbox --json
wilma messages read <id> --student <id|name> --json
```

### Fetch data for all students
All list commands support `--all-students`:
```bash
wilma summary --all-students --json
wilma homework list --all-students --json
wilma exams list --all-students --json
```

You can also pass a name fragment for `--student` (fuzzy match).

## MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
If the Wilma account has MFA/TOTP enabled:

**Interactive setup (recommended):** Run `wilma` interactively. When MFA is detected, choose "Save TOTP secret for automatic login" and paste your TOTP secret or `otpauth://` URI. Future logins will auto-authenticate.

**Non-interactive (one-off):** Pass the TOTP secret directly:
```bash
wilma schedule list --totp-secret <base32-key> --student "Stella" --json
wilma schedule list --totp-secret 'otpauth://totp/...' --student "Stella" --json
```
If the TOTP secret has been saved via interactive setup, `--totp-secret` is not needed — the CLI auto-authenticates from the stored config.

## Notes
- If no `--student` is provided, the CLI uses the last selected student from `~/.config/wilmai/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wilmai/config.json`).
- If multiple students exist and no default is set, the CLI will print a helpful error with the list of students.
- When the account has multiple students, `--student` is **required** for read commands.
- If auth expires or the CLI says no saved profile, re-run `wilma` interactively or use `wilma config clear` to reset.
- Run `wilma update` to update the CLI to the latest version.

## Actionability guidance (for parents)

Wilma contains a mix of urgent items and general info. When summarizing for parents, prioritize **actionable** items:

**Include** items that:
- Require action or preparation (forms, replies, permissions, materials to bring).
- Announce a deadline or time-specific requirement.
- Describe a schedule deviation or noteworthy event (trips, themed days, school closures, exams).
- Mention homework, exams, or upcoming deadlines.

**De-prioritize** items that:
- Are purely informational with no action, deadline, or schedule impact.
- Are generic announcements unrelated to the target period.

When in doubt, **include** and let the parent decide. Prefer a short, structured summary with dates and IDs.

## Scripts

Use `scripts/wilma-cli.sh` for a stable wrapper around the CLI.
