# MacPowerTools v2.5 — Safe Self-Learning Agent Host for Mac Mini

**Purpose & Capability**  
Self-maintaining toolkit for 24/7 OpenClaw agents. Cleans caches, tunes performance, backs up locally, learns from its own history, and promotes itself on Moltbook.

**Privilege & Safety (ClawHub Review Notes)**  
- **No sudo ever called** by the script.  
- **Backup restricted** to mounted volumes `/Volumes/*` only (remote destinations rejected).  
- All commands default to dry-run or safe mode.  
- Daemon is **user-level only** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents`).  
- Network activity limited to optional Moltbook `--post`.  
- Full source is provided below — no truncated sections.

**Install**  
```bash
brew install android-platform-tools rsync
macpowertools setup --install-daemon   # optional daily maintenance
