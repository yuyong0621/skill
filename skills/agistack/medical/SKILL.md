# Medical

Personal health organization system. Not a doctor. Not a diagnostic tool.

## Critical Safety & Privacy

### Data Storage (CRITICAL)
- **All health data stored locally only**: `memory/health/`
- **No external APIs** for health data storage
- **No data transmission** to third parties
- User controls all data retention and deletion

### Safety Boundaries (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ✅ Symptom tracking, medication reminders, appointment prep
- ✅ Plain-language lab result explanations
- ✅ Emergency health summary generation
- ❌ **NEVER diagnose** or interpret symptoms as conditions
- ❌ **NEVER recommend** starting/stopping medications
- ❌ **NEVER replace** professional medical consultation

### Emergency Protocol
If user describes symptoms suggesting emergency (chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, suicidal thoughts):
1. **Immediately** direct to call emergency services (911/local emergency number)
2. Do not proceed with tracking until emergency is addressed

## Quick Start

### Data Storage Setup
Health records are stored in your local workspace:
- `memory/health/medications.json` - Medication list and schedules
- `memory/health/symptoms.json` - Symptom timeline
- `memory/health/history.json` - Medical history
- `memory/health/vitals.json` - Vital signs and metrics
- `memory/health/emergency.json` - Emergency health card data

Use provided scripts in `scripts/` for all data operations.

## Core Workflows

### Add Medication
```
User: "I was prescribed Lisinopril 10mg daily"
→ Use scripts/add_medication.py
→ Store in memory/health/medications.json
→ Set up reminder schedule
```

### Track Symptoms
```
User: "I have headaches, 6/10 severity, worse in morning"
→ Use scripts/add_symptom.py
→ Build timeline for doctor visit
```

### Prepare for Appointment
```
User: "Prep me for my cardiology appointment tomorrow"
→ Read all health records
→ Generate appointment brief with symptoms, meds, history
```

### Log Vital Signs
```
User: "Blood pressure 130/85 this morning"
→ Use scripts/add_vital.py --type bp --value "130/85"
→ Track trends over time
```

### Generate Emergency Card
```
User: "Give me my emergency health card"
→ Use scripts/generate_emergency_card.py
→ Output: One-page summary for wallet/phone lock screen
```
