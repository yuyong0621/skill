4. Backlink metrics (referring domains, new/lost links)
5. Key performance indicators and goals for comparison
6. AI citation data if tracking GEO metrics

Proceed with the full analysis using provided data. Note in the output which metrics are from automated collection vs. user-provided data.

## Instructions

When a user requests a performance report:

1. **Define Report Parameters** -- Domain, report period, comparison period, report type (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual), audience (Executive/Technical/Client), focus areas.

2. **Create Executive Summary** -- Overall performance rating, key wins/watch areas/action required, metrics at a glance table (traffic, rankings, conversions, DA, AI citations), SEO ROI calculation.

3. **Report Organic Traffic Performance** -- Traffic overview (sessions, users, pageviews, bounce rate), traffic trend visualization, traffic by source/device, top performing pages.

4. **Report Keyword Rankings** -- Rankings overview by position range, distribution change visualization, top improvements and declines, SERP feature performance.

5. **Report GEO/AI Performance** -- AI citation overview, citations by topic, GEO wins, optimization opportunities.

6. **Report Domain Authority (CITE Score)** -- If a CITE audit has been run, include CITE dimension scores (C/I/T/E) with period-over-period trends and veto status. If no audit exists, note as "Not yet evaluated."

7. **Content Quality (CORE-EEAT Score)** -- If content-quality-auditor has been run, include average scores across all 8 CORE-EEAT dimensions with trends. If no audit exists, note as "Not yet evaluated."

8. **Report Backlink Performance** -- Link profile summary, weekly link acquisition, notable new links, competitive position.

9. **Report Content Performance** -- Publishing summary, top performing content, content needing attention, content ROI.

10. **Generate Recommendations** -- Immediate/short-term/long-term actions with priority, expected impact, and owner. Goals for next period.

11. **Compile Full Report** -- Combine all sections with table of contents, appendix (data sources, methodology, glossary).
